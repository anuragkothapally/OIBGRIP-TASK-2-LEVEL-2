                <br>
                <li> Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, Indiaâ€”died April 26, 1920</li>
                <br>
                <li>Indian mathematician whose contributions to the theory of numbers include pioneering discoveries of the properties of the partition function..</li>
                <br>
                <li>When he was 15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr's Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics</li>
                <br>
                <li>This collection of thousands of theorems, many presented with only the briefest of proofs and with no material newer than 1860, aroused his genius.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Having verified the results in Carr's book, Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems and ideas. </li>
                <br>
                <li> In 1903 he secured a scholarship to the University of Madras but lost it the following year because he neglected all other studies in pursuit of mathematics.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Ramanujan continued his work, without employment and living in the poorest circumstances </li>
                <br>
                <li>After marrying in 1909 he began a search for permanent employment that culminated in an interview with a government official, Ramachandra Rao. </li>
    
                <br>
                <li>Impressed by Ramanujan's mathematical prowess, Rao supported his research for a time, but Ramanujan, unwilling to exist on charity, obtained a clerical post with the Madras Port Trust. </li>
                <br>
                <li>In 1911 Ramanujan published the first of his papers in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.</li>
                <br>
                
                
                <li> Ramanujan's knowledge of mathematics (most of which he had worked out for himself) was startling.</li>
